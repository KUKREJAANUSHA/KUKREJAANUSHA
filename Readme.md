## Projects

**Credit Risk Management**  
Built an end-to-end pipeline for processing and modeling credit risk using Azure Data Factory, Spark, and ML models with interpretability via SHAP and LIME.

**Human Activity Recognition**  
Applied CNN and deep learning models to classify complex and simple activities using sensor data. Feature extraction included time-domain and frequency-domain methods (e.g., Fourier transforms).

**Security & Compliance Dashboards**  
Developed real-time dashboards using Power BI and SQL-based pipelines to monitor data retention and access vulnerabilities, improving security and compliance.
